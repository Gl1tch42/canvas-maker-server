## ![Canvas Maker](./.github/resources/logo.png)

Canvas Maker is an online tool to help entrepreneurs design their canval and start developing their company.

</br>

> # Personal Notes
>
> I started this project for two reasons. The first one being that I wanted to practice building an entire application from scratch. I had never done anything on this level and I wanted to challenge myself. 
> The other reason why I started this project was that I wanted to have this tool for a while and it didn`t exist, Canvas is a business model to help entrepreneurs materialize their ideas and I could never find a good online tool for it. 
> To build this project, I had to learn many new technologies that I had not had the time to use so far like typescript, how to do unit and integration tests using jest.js and how to deal with user authentication and authorization. 
> The project is not done yet but I am excited to finish and any help is welcomed.
